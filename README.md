Computer systems are never safe: they are always subject to novel ways of attacks, and hardware/software vulnerabilities. This project studies
the resistance of four types cryptographic algorithms: AES, RSA, SHA, and Kyber against well-known hardware vulnerabilies such as row hammer 
and timing side-channel, and also evaluate emerging threats, like linear and differential cryptoanalysis, and quantum attacks.

This project will utilize OpenSSL, Qiskit, and Open Quantum Safe Library to build testbench.
